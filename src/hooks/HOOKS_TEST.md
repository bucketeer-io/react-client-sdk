# React Hooks Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for React hooks in the Bucketeer React Client SDK, specifically for feature flag variation hooks.

## Overview

Our testing strategy focuses on testing hooks through React components rather than in isolation, following React testing best practices. We test user-facing behavior and integration with the React rendering cycle rather than implementation details.

## Testing Philosophy

### ✅ What We Test
- **User-facing behavior**: How hooks behave when used in real components
- **Integration with React**: Proper integration with React's rendering and state management
- **Feature flag updates**: How hooks respond to flag value changes
- **Error handling**: Fallback behavior when flags are missing or unavailable
- **Provider context**: Proper integration with `BucketeerProvider`

### ❌ What We Avoid
- **Implementation details**: Internal hook mechanics that users don't see
- **Isolated hook testing**: Testing hooks completely outside of React components
- **Mock internals**: Over-mocking of internal React behavior
